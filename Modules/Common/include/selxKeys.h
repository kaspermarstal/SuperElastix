/** Helper definitions for common cstring key values to avoid typos*/

// In SuperElastix we use cstring keys to communicate between components. The
// advantage is that user defined cstring-based configurations can directly talk to the core.
// In the core we could type these names directly as literal cstrings, but this is sensitive to typos.
// By these definitions tools such as visual assist will auto-complete when typing keys::HasP...
