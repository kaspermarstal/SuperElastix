A large diversity of image registration methodologies has emerged from the research community. 
The scattering of methods over toolboxes impedes rigorous comparison to select the appropriate method for a given application.
Toolboxes typically tailor their implementations to a mathematical registration paradigm, which makes internal functionality nonexchangeable. 
Subsequently, this forms a barrier for adoption of registration technology in the clinic.
We therefore propose a unifying, role-based software design that can integrate a broad range of functional registration components. 
These components can be configured into an algorithmic network via a single high-level user interface.
A generic component handshake mechanism provides users feedback on incompatibilities.
We demonstrate the viability of our design by incorporating two paradigms from different code bases.
The implementation is done in C++ and is available as open source. 
The progress of embedding more paradigms can be followed via \url{https://github.com/kaspermarstal/SuperElastix}
